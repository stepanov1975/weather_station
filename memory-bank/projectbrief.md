# Project Brief: Weather Claude

## 1. Project Goal

To create a desktop application that displays weather information. The specific source of the weather data and the exact features are yet to be fully defined but likely involve fetching data from an API and presenting it in a user-friendly GUI.

## 2. Core Requirements

- Fetch weather data for a specified location (or potentially the user's current location).
- Display current weather conditions (temperature, description, icon).
- Potentially display forecast information.
- Provide a graphical user interface (GUI).

## 3. Scope

- **In Scope:** Basic weather display, configuration options (e.g., location), potentially forecasts.
- **Out of Scope (Initially):** Advanced meteorological data, historical weather, user accounts, complex map integrations.

## 4. Target Audience

Users who need a quick and easy way to check the weather on their desktop.

## 5. Success Metrics

- Application successfully fetches and displays accurate weather data.
- GUI is intuitive and easy to use.
- Application is stable and performs reliably.
