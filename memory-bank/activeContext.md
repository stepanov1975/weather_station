# Active Context: Weather Claude (Post-GUI Refactor)

## 1. Current Focus

- Updating the project's Memory Bank files to reflect the recently completed GUI refactoring.
- Ensuring all documentation accurately represents the current state of the `weather_display/config.py` and `weather_display/gui/app_window.py` files.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **`weather_display/config.py`:**
    - Added detailed UI configuration sections:
        - `COLOR_THEME` / `ACTIVE_COLORS` for light/dark modes.
        - `REGION_HEIGHT_WEIGHTS` for vertical layout proportions.
        - `FONTS` dictionary for specific element font styles.
        - Granular padding/margin settings (`REGION_PADDING`, `ELEMENT_PADDING`, `TEXT_PADDING`, `ELEMENT_MARGINS`).
        - `FRAME_CORNER_RADIUS`.
        - `OPTIONAL_ELEMENTS` dictionary to toggle UI components.
    - Renamed/reorganized some existing variables for clarity.
- **`weather_display/gui/app_window.py`:**
    - Refactored the `AppWindow` class to be driven by the new configurations in `config.py`.
    - Implemented a modular layout using distinct frames for Status Bar (optional), Time/Date, Current Conditions, and Forecast regions.
    - Updated widget creation logic to use configured fonts, colors, padding, margins, and radii.
    - Made the display of Status Bar, Humidity, and Air Quality sections conditional based on `OPTIONAL_ELEMENTS` flags.
    - Added helper methods (`_get_font`, `_get_color`) for cleaner config access.

## 3. Next Steps

- Update `memory-bank/productContext.md`.
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Update `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
- Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
- Update `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
- Confirm all memory bank files accurately reflect the GUI refactoring.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- The GUI refactoring prioritized modularity and configurability, moving layout and style decisions from code to the `config.py` file.
- Adopted a component-based structure within the GUI (`AppWindow`) by dividing the UI into logical region frames.
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing core functionality (data updates).

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Configuration-Driven UI:** Layout, styling, and optional features are primarily controlled via `config.py`.
- **Modularity:** Separating UI regions into distinct frames and methods enhances maintainability.
- Adhering to Python best practices (PEP 8) and custom instructions (clear naming, comments, documentation).

## 6. Learnings & Insights

- The GUI refactoring was successful in making the UI significantly more configurable and easier to modify through the `config.py` file.
- Centralizing UI settings improves consistency and reduces the need for direct code changes for appearance adjustments.
