# Active Context: Weather Claude (Initialization)

## 1. Current Focus

- Initializing the project's Memory Bank.
- Creating the core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## 2. Recent Changes

- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`.
- Currently creating `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.

## 3. Next Steps

- Create `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
- Create `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
- Create `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Begin analyzing the existing codebase (`weather_display/` directory) to populate the Memory Bank with more specific details.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- Establishing the baseline documentation structure as defined in the initial task description.
- Inferring initial project goals based on directory structure and common application patterns.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

- Following the Memory Bank structure and update workflows meticulously.
- Adhering to Python best practices (PEP 8) as requested in custom instructions.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

- The project Memory Bank did not exist and is being created now.
- The project appears to be a Python-based weather display application.
