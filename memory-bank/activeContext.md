# Active Context: Weather Claude (API Optimization & Status Indicators)

## 1. Current Focus

- Updating the project's Memory Bank files to reflect recent changes related to API call optimization and GUI status indicator improvements.
- Ensuring all documentation accurately represents the current state of the `weather_display/services/weather_api.py`, `weather_display/main.py`, and `weather_display/gui/app_window.py` files.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **`weather_display/services/weather_api.py`:**
    - **Location Key Caching:** Verified existing persistent file caching (`location_cache.json`) for the AccuWeather location key.
    - **Conditional AQI Fetching:** Modified `get_current_weather` to only call `_get_current_aqi` if `config.OPTIONAL_ELEMENTS['show_air_quality']` is True, reducing API calls.
    - **Persistent Weather/Forecast Caching:** Implemented persistent file caching for current weather (`current_weather_cache.json`) and forecast data (`forecast_cache.json`). Methods now attempt to load valid data from these files before making API calls, improving startup and resilience.
- **`weather_display/main.py`:**
    - Added `last_accuweather_success_time` attribute to `WeatherDisplayApp` to track the timestamp of the last successful AccuWeather API call.
    - Modified `_update_accuweather_data` to update `last_accuweather_success_time` on successful fetches.
    - Modified `_update_accuweather_data` and `_update_weather` to pass connection status, API status, and the `last_accuweather_success_time` (or None for IMS updates) to the GUI's `update_status_indicators` method via `app_window.after()`.
- **`weather_display/gui/app_window.py`:**
    - **Status Indicators:** Replaced previous error-specific status indicators with two persistent labels (`network_status_label`, `api_status_label`) in `_create_status_bar`.
    - Updated `update_status_indicators` method signature to accept `last_success_time`.
    - Implemented logic in `update_status_indicators` to always display network status and API status, including the formatted time of the last successful AccuWeather call.
    - **Fullscreen Fix (Attempt 1):** Modified `_configure_fullscreen` to call `self.attributes("-fullscreen", True)` via `self.after(100, ...)` to delay the call slightly.
    - **Fullscreen Fix (Attempt 2):** Increased the delay in `_configure_fullscreen` to `self.after(500, ...)`.
    - **Fullscreen Fix (Current):** Changed `_configure_fullscreen` to bind the `_apply_fullscreen` logic to the window's `<Map>` event instead of using `self.after()`. This triggers fullscreen when the window is actually displayed, aiming for better reliability on platforms like Raspberry Pi 4. Added `_apply_fullscreen_event` handler which unbinds itself after the first trigger.
    - **Bug Fix:** Removed an erroneous call to `update_status_indicators` from within `update_current_weather` that was causing a `TypeError` and preventing weather data display.
    - **Bug Fix:** Corrected indentation errors within the `_apply_fullscreen` method's exception handling.

## 3. Next Steps

- Update `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
- Update `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
- **Done:** Added color configuration keys (`status_ok_text`, `status_warning_text`, `status_error_text`) to `config.py` to enable visual feedback in the status bar.
- Confirm all memory bank files accurately reflect the recent changes.
- Consider adding localization for the new status indicator text ("Network: OK", "API: Limit", etc.).

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- Prioritized reducing unnecessary AccuWeather API calls through conditional fetching and persistent caching.
- Improved user feedback by making status indicators persistent and more informative (including last success time).
- Addressed GUI bugs related to status updates.
- Iteratively improved fullscreen initialization logic for better platform compatibility (Raspberry Pi 4), moving from `self.after()` delays to event binding (`<Map>`).

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Configuration-Driven UI:** Continues to be a core principle.
- **Modularity:** Maintained separation between services, main logic, and GUI.
- **Caching:** Employing both in-memory and persistent file caching for API data (location key, current weather, forecast) to optimize performance and reduce API usage.
- **Thread Safety:** Using `app.after(0, ...)` to schedule GUI updates from background threads.
- Adhering to Python best practices (PEP 8) and custom instructions.

## 6. Learnings & Insights

- Persistent caching for weather/forecast data improves the user experience during startup and temporary network/API outages.
- Conditional fetching based on configuration (`OPTIONAL_ELEMENTS`) is an effective way to reduce API load.
- Careful management of GUI updates from background threads is crucial.
- Using event bindings (like `<Map>`) can be more reliable than fixed delays (`self.after`) for handling window initialization events, especially across different platforms/window managers.
- Thorough testing is needed after refactoring, as parameter changes in one method can affect callers (e.g., the `TypeError` in `update_current_weather`).
