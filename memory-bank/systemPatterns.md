# System Patterns: Weather Claude

## 1. Overall Architecture (Inferred)

The application appears to follow a modular design, separating concerns into distinct components:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Interface (GUI)] --> B(Application Logic / Main);
    B --> C{Configuration};
    B --> D[Service Layer];
    D --> E{External APIs (Weather)};
    B --> F[Utilities];

    subgraph weather_display
        direction LR
        subgraph gui
            A
        end
        subgraph services
            D
        end
        subgraph utils
            F
        end
        B
        C
    end

    style gui fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style services fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style utils fill:#cfc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

- **GUI (`weather_display/gui/`):** Handles user interaction and presentation. The specific library (Tkinter, PyQt, etc.) is not yet confirmed.
- **Application Logic (`weather_display/main.py`):** Orchestrates the application flow, connecting GUI actions to services and utilities.
- **Configuration (`weather_display/config.py`):** Manages application settings, potentially including API keys, default locations, etc.
- **Service Layer (`weather_display/services/`):** Encapsulates logic for fetching external data, particularly weather information (`weather_api.py`, `ims_lasthour.py`). This isolates the core application from the specifics of data sources.
- **Utilities (`weather_display/utils/`):** Provides common helper functions, such as icon handling (`icon_handler.py`) and potentially localization (`localization.py`).
- **Assets (`weather_display/assets/`):** Stores static resources like weather icons.

## 2. Key Technical Decisions (Inferred)

- **Python Language:** The core application is written in Python.
- **Packaging:** Standard Python packaging (`setup.py`, `requirements.txt`) is used, suggesting potential distribution via pip.
- **Modularity:** Code is broken down into packages and modules (`gui`, `services`, `utils`).
- **External Data Fetching:** Relies on external services/APIs for weather data.

## 3. Design Patterns (Potential)

- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear division between UI, business logic (services), and utility functions.
- **Service Layer:** Abstracting data access behind dedicated service modules.
- **Configuration Management:** Centralized configuration likely handled by `config.py`.

## 4. Component Relationships

- The `main.py` likely initializes the `gui`, `config`, and `services`.
- The `gui` interacts with `main` or potentially directly with `services` (less ideal) to display data.
- `services` fetch data from external sources.
- `utils` are likely used by various components (`gui`, `services`, `main`).

## 5. Critical Implementation Paths

- **Data Fetching:** The reliability and structure of the `services` modules are critical for core functionality.
- **GUI Rendering:** The `gui` module is responsible for presenting information to the user.
- **Configuration Loading:** Correctly loading settings from `config.py` is essential for operation.
