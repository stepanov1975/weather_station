"""
Graphical User Interface (GUI) Package for Weather Display.

This package encapsulates all components related to the visual presentation
of the weather information. It primarily contains the main application window
(`AppWindow`), which defines the layout, widgets, and update logic for the
user interface built using the CustomTkinter library.

Modules within this package are responsible for:
- Creating and arranging UI elements (labels, frames, icons).
- Receiving data updates from the main application controller.
- Displaying time, date, current weather, forecast, and status indicators.
