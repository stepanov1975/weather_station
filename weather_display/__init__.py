Weather Display Application Package.

This package forms the core of the Weather Display application, designed to fetch
and present weather information on a display, particularly suited for devices
like the Raspberry Pi 4.

It encompasses several key sub-packages and modules:
- config: Handles application settings and API keys.
- gui: Manages the graphical user interface elements and layout.
- services: Contains clients for interacting with external weather APIs (e.g.,
  AccuWeather, IMS) and time services.
- utils: Provides helper functions, localization support, and weather icon
  management.
