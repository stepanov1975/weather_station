"""
Centralized Configuration for the Weather Display Application.

This module consolidates all user-configurable settings and constants required
for the Weather Display application. By centralizing these values, it simplifies
management, customization, and maintenance of the application's behavior.

Settings include:
- General application parameters (title, language, dimensions).
- API endpoint details and keys (AccuWeather, IMS).
- Data refresh intervals for different services.
- Location settings for weather data retrieval.
- User interface (UI) customizations (theme, fonts, colors, padding, sizes).
- Flags for enabling/disabling features like fullscreen or mock data usage.

It is recommended to configure sensitive information like API keys using
environment variables for better security practices, although defaults can be
set here.
